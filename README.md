jobs and render them directly in the Picture Viewer using the external
or Team Render.

## Scripts

Three scripts that help you set-up the render queue are included.

- object_passes
- queue_current_project
- takes

> **Note**: Due to a Cinema 4D bug introduced in R17.053 which is only fixed
> in R18.039 and newer, the *"takes"* script does not function!
